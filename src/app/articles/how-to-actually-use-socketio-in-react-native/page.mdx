Official [websocket support](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html) landed in React Native core in October. If you want to use socket.io with React Native you need to hack around socket.io a bit because the client was originally built for the browser, and since the React Native runtime isn’t a browser, it won’t work right out of the box.

Previously you might have run into [this guide](http://browniefed.com/blog/2015/05/16/react-native-and-socket-dot-io/) which outlined a couple of the gotchya’s. However, there are two problem with the method proposed in that guide:

- You can’t use the debugger. WTF! This turns developing a React Native app from fun to a nightmare really quick.
- You aren’t actually using websockets! You’re using the ajax long-polling fallback built in to Socket.io.

Here’s how we are **actually **using socket.io in React Native to communicate over websockets with [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/). **Edit #1:**A [PR to engine.io](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-parser/pull/55) that fixes this was merged a while ago but we’re still waiting on a socket.io release. ** Edit #2:** Socket.io v1.5.1 has been released and has the fix to engineio-parser, so you don’t need to set `window.navigator` anymore. You should also be able to `import io from 'socket.io-client/socket.io'` now.

Now you can actually have speedy real-time React Native apps using socket.io. Happy coding! Big thanks to 

I’m one of the creators of Feathers — a minimalist real-time JavaScript framework. With [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com/) we’ve made it easy to build real-time apps in both the browser and React Native. It’s kind of like Meteor but much more flexible and works seamlessly with React Native.

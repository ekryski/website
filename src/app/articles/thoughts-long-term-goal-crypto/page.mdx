I truly believe in and want to see permissionless and open global commerce exist. Bitcoin started this idea, but it's not the solution.

I think having incorruptible money on a common ledger (or series of common interoperable ones) is a precursor to human progress. And I think the only way to do that is if you make the tools to transact open and free, and utilize good token economics to incentivize behaviour that is for the greater good, and disincentivize selfish behaviour. Hence why a native token is necessary.

It is the tool for incentivizing community behaviour for the greater good. Nothing more, nothing less.

If the economic model is done well, with a positive feedback loop, it will naturally accrue in value (both in purchasing power and fiat terms) and it will play a critical role in raising the productive output of humanity.

This may sound a little "hippy dippy and futuristic" but I'm deadly serious. All the signs are there (both in and out of crypto) that we **need **a different incorruptible monetary system that will enable **everyone** to participate in the global economy. No matter where they were born, their skin colour, who they worship, or who they love.

The only way to align parties that wouldn't normally do so is through economic incentives. We've seen this over and over throughout history. People don't get along because of our tribal nature and different values, but by pandering to the human nature of greed and wanting to be part of a productive group, people will work together. This is acutely present within the tribalism that exists in crypto itself.

Thus far through history, money has always been influenced by people of power. This then gives small groups of people great power, which, at worse they use for self interests, and at best they make feeble attempts to tweak knobs in a system that is far too complex and dynamic for a small group of humans to adequately manage.

With this technology, a better system can emerge (because of the shared ledger and the cryptography) that is more akin to an organic biological system powered by rules encoded in smart contracts that automatically adapt to the behaviour of the network participants and the network itself. The trick is getting real-time data access of verifiable transactions, and determining what the system should optimize for.

In my mind the core optimization goals should be:

* Enable **anyone** to have easy access and participation (ie. censorship resistance and the same starting line); and
* Maximize economic output of the entire network.

Then let the invisible hand of the network, work.

This is the ultimate long term potential of crypto. An entirely new, incorruptible monetary system that enables a fair playing field for all.

I don't know what it is about the flip of the calendar page, but for some reason or another, it gives one a tiny moment of pause in order to gain some clarity and optimism towards the next calendar year.

Which seems rather silly when you think about it because it's not like you couldn't do this any other day of the year. And it's not as if meaningful change is just going to happen when the clock strikes midnight.

But that's at least the way I've looked at ringing in the New Year. A time for peaceful self reflection.

So for a long time, at the end of each year, I've built up a habit of writing down and reflecting on what went well and what didn't go as planned over the course of the year. As well as what I'm looking forward to in the next year.

I've always kept this to myself. Generally, I'm pretty private but one of the realizations I had this year is just how important relationships are. And in any relationship it's a two-way dialogue. If you are closed up and never share anything or put yourself out there, you are certainly not going to build relationships. Especially, meaningful ones.

So while in the wake of "cancel culture" and with some apprehension, in 2021 I've decided to try an experiment. I'm going to try and be more open, vulnerable, and transparent. And get back into the writing I enjoy.

Maybe, if nothing else, this will help someone in the way that Brad Feld helped me this year (more on that later). So, this year, I've decided to share my personal journal to myself. Unfiltered. For better or worse.

## Reflections on 2020. Probably the best and worst year of my life.

> January 3rd, 2021

Man, I'm a little late to the 2020 reflections party but let's be honest, I need to stop putting undo pressure on myself around these little things. It is what it is…. enjoy it!

Frankly, until this week, I wasn't even in the headspace to reflect and look forward to 2021 so it's totally fair. You can't adequately reflect without giving yourself the space from the noise of daily life.

I spent most of my Christmas "break" finalizing our corporate year end, wrapping up some outstanding tasks of my own and doing a little bit of customer support. Definitely not the most exciting holiday!

Just like in 2019, I had intended on taking a break (and desperately needed it) but that wasn't the way the cards played out again. I guess I really have no one else to blame but myself for that.

Not that my Christmas was bad… far from it! I still spent time with my wife and kids. I continued to teach my kids how to skate (they are getting so good!), we built Lego on Christmas day, watched Pixar's Soul in our jammies and I was able to see my brother and my parents (albeit from distance).

I feel really grateful for that and compared to 2019 I did a much better job of balancing things during this break. That's probably why I feel quite refreshed this time around. A bit of work and a bit of play.

However, old habits die hard, as they say… something I'd really like to correct this year:

* Keep the ambition but dial back the self-induced pressure;
* Stop overcommitting myself and be realistic with timelines

While everyone else in the company was taking a well deserved and much needed break, I was still putting in 8+ hour work days (except for Christmas Day). Including working well into the night on New Year's Eve after my kids and wife had gone to bed.

This isn't to gloat or pat myself on the back. This is *not* how holidays should be. That's not even an actual holiday. I basically took a weekend off.

That's not what I had planned, and I'll admit that for part of the "holiday" I was kind of grumpy about it. But over the break I also came to one of the 3 main things I learned this year.

> Only worry about what you can control and be happy with "what is" no matter the choices you make.

However, I'm sharing this for 4 reasons:

1. To show other entrepreneurs (or aspiring ones) that it's not all glamour. Sometimes, especially as a founder of a young company, in order to make it work you need to do the shit no one else wants to.
2. To remind myself, and others, that life is all about balance. Having positive momentum in *all* aspects of your life produces the best results and the most happiness. It makes it so much easier to handle when some things inevitably don't go your way.
3. To apologize to some of the people I have disappointed or gone MIA on over the latter half of the year.

On the last 2 points, there are two things that really hit me this year:

### Having achievable goals and hitting them consistently is more important than lofty goal setting that you may or may not hit.

Until this year I've subscribed to the mantra "shoot for the moon, if you miss you'll hit the stars". It's taken me an embarrassingly long time to recognize that this doesn't work.

This frustrated many people (including my wife) because

### Mental and physical health is extremely important.

I'm no stranger to being physically active. Between high level soccer and then speedskating from the age of 12 until I was 25 I was training 6 days a week. Sometimes twice a day with very little break in between.

By the time I decided to retire from speed skating I didn't even want to look at the inside of a gym. And ever since then I've found myself on/off the exercise wagon just as much as the next person. However, I know that when I'm physically active every day I'm a much happier, much more productive person.

So it's really about getting back into better habits and sticking with them. I've also recognized that I can push myself mentally and physically harder than a lot of people for sustained periods of time. I attribute this to when I was speedskating.

Very few things will teach you more about mental fortitude than the pain in your legs from insane lactic acid build up in your body. Where, no matter how hard you will yourself, you legs don't want to move. You're vision is cloudy. You are light-headed and feel like you might pass out at any minute. Welcome to the last 50 metres of the 1500m race.

For me, even if I can push myself hard, over 6+ months I'm much more productive if I'm taking care of all aspects of my well being. Not just "crushing work".

## The worst day of my life

## The day it all changed

In August, for the first time in my life, I suffered from extreme burnout that led to a debilitating depression. In hindsight the truly debilitating part was brief and only lasted 10 days, but when I was in it, it felt like an eternity. I had zero productivity for about 2 weeks, but it has taken me until about now to fully recover and feel happy with life.

I attribute a large part of this to my incredible wife, who was my shoulder to cry on (even when she didn't fully understand), my kids and dog who unconditionally love me, my parents and brother, my cousin Jason and strangely, Brad Feld.

Brad and I have never met. As a startup founder, I've read some of his work and always respected him but I remember vividly the day that a switch flipped for me.

One day in August I was shooting hoops by myself while listening to the Tim Ferris podcast. The sun was shining. The weather was perfect. My shirt was off.

I still remember that "empty" feeling I felt. Emotionless.

At first, the podcast started off with the usual pleasantries and then some discussion about startups, etc. However, after some time Brad started talking about his own mental health and describing exactly how I was feeling:

* The urge to push your own boundaries but continually burning out;
* The feeling of having a never ending backlog of tasks to complete and problems to solve;
* The guilt of taking a break when there are people that depend on you; and finally,
* The fact that people may depend on you, and things may fall by the wayside, but that it'll still be okay. That taking a week or two to yourself, almost never kills a company and your dreams.

I felt like he was speaking directly to me at that moment.

Brad, you may never see this, but I can honestly say that your words changed my life. That was the turning point for me. To know that I wasn't alone. That I wasn't crazy. That these feelings weren't just my own insecurities, projected self-importance, and control freak-ness.

Startups are full of ups and downs, and I'm definitely no stranger to having to push through pain. But this was different, and not something I had felt before - hopelessness.

Now, I realize that this may sound very trivial and like I'm just a whiney white tech bro, to some. I also know that I am incredibly fortunate and that there are *tons* of people around the world that have to deal with WAY more hardship than I ever have. In fact, this is why I started Bidali - to make it my life's work to give everyone in the world financial empowerment and economic freedom.

I've always wanted to help others and make an impact, but this year is the year I truly learned about empathy.

I'm not saying I'm great at it but I feel like I have made a real positive step forward. Before this burnout episode I too, often trivialized others' problems and felt they should "toughen up". That they were weak. That's just not true.

An important lesson that everyone should learn, especially in 2021, is to attempt to walk a mile in another person's shoes. Everyone has their own personal struggles and what may seem trivial to you may in fact be a big deal to someone else because you can't experience what they do. One's own personal struggle does not make it any less important than another's.

Since Bidali started in 2018 I've been working 12-16 hours a day almost every single day. On top of that, through 2019 I was traveling and away from my family for 4 months of year. This is just not sustainable.

I desperately needed a break over Christmas in 2019, but right before the holidays I was presented with the opportunity to travel to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum in January. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, so of course I jumped at it (thanks Mark). As a result I spent all of that Christmas break working to prepare for being away.

And while I don't regret that decision, what I do regret is not taking a proper break when I came back. Instead I jumped right into the same work mode and by August I became so exhausted that it pushed me into my first ever depression.

Even saying that feels weird. I've always considered myself pretty mentally tough, so admitting that vulnerability still feels hard, but it's true.

My breaking point was laying on the couch in my office all day, pretending to work but just really hoping my backlog of problems I need to solve would just go away.

But someone has to do it and as CEO of Bidali I see myself as having 3 main roles:

1. Telling our story in a relatable way that gets people excited;
2. Guiding the direction of our business based on my understanding of technology, macro and micro events; and
3. Being the support for everyone else on the team

It's with mixed emotions that I look back on 2020 and forward to 2021.

2020 was an exhausting year for me. Fortunately, not for many of the same reasons as most. While COVID has undoubtedly brought strain to EVERY business and every individual, for us at Bidali and my family it was pretty different.

At Bidali, we operate in the digital payments space and at the forefront of blockchain applications within it. Both of which have had tremendous growth as a result of the rapid push to digitize everything and the need for more efficient touchless payments.

Mainly because our small team has been punching above its weight for a while now. While that has led to tremendous growth (both personally and professionally), it has come at cost.

## Looking forward

As we move into 2021, I'm committed to maintaining better balance. I'll keep the ambition but dial back the self-induced pressure. I'll be more realistic with timelines and stop overcommitting. Most importantly, I'll remember that taking care of my mental and physical health isn't optional—it's the foundation that makes everything else possible.

I'm grateful for the lessons of 2020, even the painful ones. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me through it.

The largest super powers in history have had a lot of natural resources, dominated pivotal new technologies, exported their currency and made it easy for others to use their currency and invest in their economies.

This is the future Canada can have. Think bold. Invest in natural resources, medicine, clean energy, automated manufacturing, software and the skilled workers to support those industries (including reselling and easy immigration programs). Launch a CBDC to reduce payment costs and capital efficiency. Similar to China, pilot internally and then expand access to major trade partners and emerging markets that are looking for financial stability, better financial access, lower cost of capital, trust and good trade partners.

Very important in the macro economic and geopolitical climate when China is pushing their Belt & Road initiative and global trade is very quickly becoming multi-currency as opposed to USD denominated.

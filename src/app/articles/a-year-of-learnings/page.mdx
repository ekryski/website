Well, it’s a new year and time for resolutions! I actually enjoy making new resolutions each year. They give me something to strive for. Being honest, come December I usually haven’t fulfilled them to the extent that I had intended when the calendar rolled over; but at least I took steps in the right direction.

Starting last year I’ve become more data driven about many of my decisions and I think the biggest reason why the majority of my resolutions don’t feel “complete” is because I rarely set quantitative goals for them. Which is why this year I’ve decided to put actionable, measurable deliverables to my resolutions, so that I can more [accurately gauge success and celebrate progress](http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2014/11/26/4-agile-startup-hacks-that-can-transform-your-business/).

> **One article a week for an entire year about something that I have learned.**

Over the course of the year I’m going to attempt to write 1 article a week for an entire year about something that I have learned. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some really bright people and also learned some shitty lessons the hard way. I thought I would share some of the things I learn in order to help others avoid some of the mistakes I’ve made, improve my writing skills, and, quite frankly, to keep a record of this year so that I can remember the highs and the lows.

I’m a curious person and am continually learning. I currently have a keen interest in:

- Political Transparency
- Woodworking
- Architecture & Furniture Design
- Finance & Economics
- Software Development & Technology
- Machine Learning & AI
- Startups & Startup Culture

My posts throughout the year will most likely be related, but probably not limited, to these topics. So with this inaugural post, here goes nothing!

If you’d like to keep up with my progress you can [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/ekryski) or [check out my other articles](https://medium.com/@ekryski/latest).

> I have been working myself up to publicly committing to doing this so I’m already nearly 2 weeks behind. I’m giving myself some leniency on having a new post every single week (shit happens) but I’m going to strive to maintain that cadence since f[orming habits is a successful life hack](https://blog.bufferapp.com/what-the-research-on-habit-formation-reveals-about-willpower-and-overall-well-being). Regardless of my establishing a routine I will have 52 thoughtful pieces by December 31st, 2015.

2022 was a wild year for the world from a global economic perspective. The reflexive ripple effect in response to the COVID pandemic has produced a lot of uncertainty and some serious whipsaw volatility in asset prices. Nothing reflected this more than the nascent, mania filled crypto markets and tech stocks in general.

After a few boom and bust cycles, we're now entering what I think is crypto's "Dot Com Bust" moment. This time it's different.

First, let me highlight the similarities.

Similar to the Dot Com era around the turn of the millennia, over the last decade we had promising technology emerge with real breakthroughs in computer science, economic incentive design, large scale game theory, and novel broader applications of cryptography.

There was a slow, but gradual ramp up of "early adopters" where tinkerers, dreamers, visionaries and even criminals all pitched their heart out, experimented with the technology, and demonstrated proof of concepts that were convincing enough to garner billions in venture capital funding fuelled by euphoric hopium of the sci-fi future.

Much like the Internet in the late 90s and early 2000s, the maturity of the technology and also the broad understanding around crypto is still so early when you look at the usage numbers:

* ~1.1MM DAU across all major "dApp" chains
* Estimated ~420MM crypto holders for 2023 globally

If we compare that to the ~5.07B Internet users and ~5.48B mobile phone users we have today, the market penetration is still infinitesimal.

If you, like me, think the majority of money (and commerce) will be digital and cryptographically secure (regardless of whether it's decentralized, a stablecoin and/or a CBDC) it's clear that crypto-currency has a ton of room to grow given money is one of the few things that nearly everyone **needs** in order to function in society and participate in the global economy.

As the seasons turned and the experimentation with yield farming/liquidity incentive experiments "DeFi Summer" has faded into a distant memory, RIP the good times. Through 2022 we saw the sequential and catastrophic implosion of Terra, 3 Arrows Capital, Voyager, Celsius, FTX, Genesis, Grayscale, and now possibly many other groups to come that relied on the same counterparties to juice yields and offer a seemingly "risk free" high yield.

As the central banks around the world tightened their balance sheets and raised interest rates, the tide went out and left all platforms that relied on the infinite money printing machine, standing naked and quivering.

All the platforms (and sadly their users) relying on the too-good-to-be-true yields are learning some hard lessons:

1. The markets will humble you;
2. Don't fight the Fed; and
3. There is no free lunch

We're now in the "Trough of Despair" and given how much global awareness, apprehension and capital loss there has been as a result of the wealth destruction over the last year (which retail largely took the brunt of), the crypto industry, much like the dot com era, has had the rope bridge that was being used to "cross the chasm" to mainstream adoption swiftly and abruptly cut.

Just like in the movies, there will be companies that fall to their death and there will be people who stare across at the humongous gap and decide to pack it in and given up.

However, just like in the movies we'll also see some existing and new characters emerge that find a different way to cross that chasm.

While the Dot Com bust took 3 years to go from peak to trough, I think that business cycles in general are accelerated now due to the Internet and how quickly social sentiment can shift because of social platforms and the ability for ideas to round trip the globe in mere seconds.

In the tech sector this is even more pronounced because techies are early adopters and the ability to iterate on new ideas has dramatically accelerated in a post Github era. The ability to "fork" a Github repo in order to remix it and/or contribute back with just a few clicks has resulted in a Cambrian explosion of ideas and code.

Crypto and AI are the two fastest growing open source software segments in large part because these two technologies have sparked the imagination and curiosity of some of the most ambitious and intelligent builders because they have produced some early but **real** technology breakthroughs.

While crypto has taken a serious beating in 2022 and will likely continue to get kicked while it's down through the majority of 2023, just like the Internet in the year 2000, it's clearly not dead. We've seen too much innovation, too many bright minds, and too much capital flow into it.

So I think while it does still take time for the gears of human psychology (social consensus), macro cycles, government and courts to play out, I expect that we will see a similar pattern to the Dot Com bust emerge with crypto, but instead of it being 3 years from peak to trough and a decade long rebuild phase, we'll see that cycle period cut in half.

We now have "decentralized" open source payment networks that can compete with the speeds of Visa, Mastercard, SWIFT and PayPal, the 4 largest global payment networks in the world. However, unlike them, you do not need permission to utilize them, and thus far, they are proving to be just as resilient if not more due to their distributed global nature of servers that power these networks.

The killer app for crypto has been and will always be payments and better, lower cost access to capital. This is the use case that will cross the chasm to mainstream.

Not NFTs. Not yields based inflation and speculation. Not fractional asset ownership or plots of land and jpegs in the metaverse.

Those things may gain broader adoption longer term, but the key to unlocking any potential in crypto and DeFi primitives in a broad way will be if cryptocurrency is being used for real commerce and productive economic activity directly (ie. buying food, paying bills, earning income).

I think with the growth of stablecoins like USDC, BUSD and USDT, and the rapid maturation of some of these fifth generation distributed networks that support fast, low cost stablecoin transactions reliably, we're seeing the early signs of cryptocurrency being used for real world commerce, particularly in LatAm, Africa and Southeast Asia.

The macro set up for strong USD demand, with restricted supply will further incentivize adoption of USD denominated mediums of exchange that are easier to access and transact with in-person and online. It's hard to see cryptocurrency not filling the need, particularly in markets where USD liquidity is generally lacking due to high cost or untrustworthy intermediaries.
